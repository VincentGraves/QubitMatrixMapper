# Qubit Matrix Mapper

This is a python script for generating a qubit Hamiltonian using a first-quantised version of the Qubit Efficient Encoding scheme proposed by Shee et al. (DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.023154).

## Dependencies

Python 3.8.6 was used to write the script.
Numpy, OpenFermion and Itertools are also required.

## Example

An example input and output (including qubit Hamiltonian) has been provided for the chemical HCl in the minimumal basis (STO-3G).

## Usage

./QMM < input_QMM.json > output.out

## Future Plans

I do not intend on continuing to work on this. However, if there are any issues please flag them to me.

## Authors

This script was written and is managed by Vincent Graves.
